# Passby Function

## C++ Program to solve a problem

Cost and number purchased passed to a value returning function where extension is calculated (cost * number). The cost will be passed by reference and number passed by value. If the price exceeds $100.00 a 5% discount will be applied. The result will be passed back to the main program.

From the main body of the program pass the calculated amount to an non value returning function. This function will display a simple report like: "The total cost of the product is: $285.00 and the individual cost is: $100.00"

When the program has completed (in the main body of the program) it will display: "Cost Program Completed."
